What is Sucrecoin?
----------------

Sucrecoin is a highly secure store of value with fast transaction times designed to be used as a currency. 
We implemented the newest Proof-of-Work algorithm, as well as Proof-of-Stake, to meet these stringent security standards.

We promote a super secure and energy-efficient PoW/PoS Coin featuring the latest advanced 0% PoS by Ghostlander.
Sucrecoin utilizes a multi-algo implementation to ensure the highest level security with NeoScrypt PoW, Sha256d PoS, and BLAKE2s for Block Hashing. 
Coins will be produced via PoW and PoS. Sucrecoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Sucrecoin Core software, see https://sucrecoin.com/#wallets, or read the
